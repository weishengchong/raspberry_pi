1) Install cgroup-bin

sudo apt-get install cgroup-bin

2) Reboot. cgroups is now located at /sys/fs/cgroup

3) Make a cgroup for your user (the owner of the process)

# Change $USER to the system user running your process.
sudo cgcreate -a $USER -g memory,cpu:$USER

4) Your user can them manage resources. By default users get 1024 cpu units (shares), so to limit to about 10 % cpu , memory is in bytes ...

# About 10 % cpu
echo 100 > /cgroup/cpu/$USER/cpu.shares

# 10 Mb
echo 10000000 > /cgroup/memory/$USER/memory.limit_in_bytes

5) Start your process (change exec to cgexec)

# -g specifies the control group to run the process in
# Limit cpu
cgexec -g cpu:$USER command <options> &

# Limit cpu and memory
cgexec -g memory,cpu:$USER command <options> &
